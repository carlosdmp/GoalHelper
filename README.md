# Goal Helper

Goal Helper is a todo app, with the purpose of learning things that I have not had the opportunity yet.

## Tech
### Kotlin 
Because we are already in 2019, c'mon
### Kotlin coroutines
### From Android Jetpack
* Room
* ViewModel
* LiveData
* Navigation
* DataBinding

### Koin
Really simple and efficient dependency injection, after dealing with Dagger I'm really happy to use this instead, but this project is also really small so I don't have a winner yet.
### Diff Adapter
Android module made by me with the idea of using diff Util to have efficient, beatiful and easy to create recycler views.
It uses DiffUtil to diff between the old model list and the new one, and notify the adapter with the exact changes.

Note: This is a toy project, IÂ´m using all the new things I can, even if maybe the best choice was to use some already known thing.

## Next work (todos of the todo app)
* Explore jetpack foundation components
* Explore jetpack paging
* Insert out-of-the-app functionality (notifications, slices, share, ...)
* Improve the design

## Wanna say something?
Every review is welcome :)
