# Goal Helper

Goal Helper is a todo app, with the purpose of learning things that I have not had the opportunity yet.

## Tech
### Kotlin
Because we are already in 2019, c'mon
### From Android Jetpack
* DataBinding
* LiveData
* Navigation
* Room
* ViewModel
* Fragment
* Layout
### Koin
Really simple and efficient dependency injection, after dealing with Dagger I'm really happy to use this instead, but this project is also really small so I don't have a winner yet.

Note: This is a prototype, I'm still learning about some things that I'm using here

## Next work (todos of the todo app)
* Explore jetpack foundation components
* Explore jetpack lifecycle and paging components
* Research WorkManager vs Coroutines
* Insert out-of-the-app functionality (notifications, slices, share, ...)
* Improve animations and design

## Wanna say something?
Every review is welcome :)
